/**
  Saves the current CPU context that can be restored with a call to LongJump()
  and returns 0.

  Saves the current CPU context in the buffer specified by JumpBuffer and
  returns 0. The initial call to SetJump() must always return 0. Subsequent
  calls to LongJump() cause a non-zero value to be returned by SetJump().

  If JumpBuffer is NULL, then ASSERT().
  For Itanium processors, if JumpBuffer is not aligned on a 16-byte boundary, then ASSERT().
  
  NOTE: The structure BASE_LIBRARY_JUMP_BUFFER is CPU architecture specific.
  The same structure must never be used for more than one CPU architecture context.
  For example, a BASE_LIBRARY_JUMP_BUFFER allocated by an IA-32 module must never be used from an x64 module. 
  SetJump()/LongJump() is not currently supported for the EBC processor type.   

  @param  JumpBuffer  A pointer to CPU context buffer.

  @retval 0 Indicates a return from SetJump().
